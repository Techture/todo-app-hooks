# TODO App

## This app uses hooks to manage state. Select from the dropdown, filtering the list to view 'All', 'Completed', or "Uncompleted" todo's. You can add, toggle status, and delete a todo.

• hooks
• iterating
• mapping
• props
• manipulate lists
• toggle button

## Requirements

1. [x] Create a Todo App using the supplied todos as initial state - done
2. [ ] App should be able to add, edit, and delete todos. The list should update automatically without refreshing the page
3. [x] The app should be able to toggle the completed status of the todo from done to incomplete
4. [x] No using class components, only use function components with hooks
5. [x] No using redux or any other state management library.
6. [ ] Each todo item should have an edit button, a delete button and a toggle done button. Clicking delete, deletes that item from the list. Clicking edit allows you to edit the name of the todo item inline. Clicking toggle done toggles the state of the todo from done to not done, this should be displayed like a radio button.
